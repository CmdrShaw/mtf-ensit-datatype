        <p>This work takes a NIEM-based approach to describe the MIL-STD-6040 USMTF-XML messages ENSIT (Enemy Situational Awareness) and EOBSREP (Enemy Observation Report).  ENSIT and EOBSREP where chosen as initial candidate messages because their content most closely resemble a USA SIGACT (Significant Activity) message implemented by USMC MC2SA TSOA.</p>  
          
        <p>SIGACT is a message data type implemented by USA C2 systems, CPOF is one of them.  SIGACT messages are proprietary to USA, whereas USMTF is a Joint Military message standard.  Therefore, interoperability between tactical data systems is gained from facilitating data exchanges between SIGACT and USMTF compatible endpoints.</p>  
        
        <p>Within the Maven directory structure, the folder [ <a href="./src/main/resources" target="_blank">/src/main/resources ] contains most of the source content that comprises this work product.</p>  
            
        <p>The folder [ /src/main/resources ] closely resembles the sample NIEM MPD folder structure described in [ <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/model-package-description/3.0/model-package-description-3.0.html#appendix_E" target="_blank">NIEM Model Package Description Specification</a> ].  The resources folder contains folders for XML Schema files and sample instances, message data component mappings, validation and transformation instruction files, and development resources and tests.</p>
        
        <p>For more information, see the documentation folder.  Also, view readme files in the respective folder for specific instructions.

        <p>This work is derived from authoritative MIL-STD-6040 USMTF XML work maintained at the [ <a href="https://software.forge.mil/sf/projects/mtfxml" target="_blank">MTFXML project</software></a> ] at software.forge.mil.</p>
