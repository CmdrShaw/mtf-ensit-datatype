        <title>Approach for Developing NIEM-Based SOI-Provided Data Types</title>

    <body>
        <p>This work is part of a larger effort on producing NIEM-based SOI-provided data types.  The effort is driven by a call for the adoption of a [ <a href="https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/niem.aspx" target="_blank">NIEM-based</a> ] approach to the implemention of standards-based XML data exchanges.  Therefore, the work implements the NIEM data component framework, which includes selected community described data components, wherever applicable.  In addition, the work follows NIEM guidelines and conformance rules.</p>
        <p>This work also strives to create a product that software developers can deploy, exercise, and reuse.  Beyond creating static XML Schema documents, this work includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  Git repository for maximum portability</li>
            <li>  Ant and Maven-driven test, build, and packaging automation</li>
            <li>  XSL 3.0 XML and JSON data format transformations</li>
            <li>  XSL Schematron build and application rule validation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Directive</h1>
        <p>The memorandum "Adoption of the National Information Exchange Model within the Department of Defense" (March 28, 2013) calls for the adoption of the NIEM-based approach for implementing standards-based XML data exchanges.</p>

        <h1>Adoption</h1>
        <p>SOI-provided XML data types shall be migrated over time in accordance to the NIEM-based approach.  NIEM-based data types may be deployed in parallel with non-NIEM-based data types.  Parallel support of both data types should maximize the capatibilities of end-points that only support non-NIEM-based data types.  Non-NIEM-based data types shall be sunset when all relevant end-points support NIEM-based data types.</p>
         <p>New SOI XML data types shall be developed in accordance to the NIEM-based approach.</p>
        
        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>The development of a SOI-provided NIEM-based data type shall include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  [ <a href="https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/Exchange-Map-and-Model.aspx" target="_blank">Identify and swap</a> ] data components with NIEM data components, where possible</li>
            <li>  [ <a href="https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/Exchange-Build-and-Validate.aspx" target="_blank">Encode</a> ] XML Schema in accordance to [ <a href="http://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/3.0/" target="_blank">NIEM guidelines</a> ]</li>
            <li>  Map data components for a non-NIEM-based data type to a NIEM-based data type, and the converse</li>
            <li>  Develop a capability to validate application rules</li>
            <li>  Develop a capability to transform a non-NIEM-based data type to a NIEM-based data type, and the converse</li>
            <li>  Automate the validation of data structures and application rules for XML instances</li>
            <li>  Automate the testing and build process that assembles the [ <a href="https://www.niem.gov/technical/Pages/Exchange-Assemble-And-Document.aspx" target="_blank">NIEM-based data type package</a> ]</li>
            <li>  Automate the distribution of changes to managed repositories, to include Software Forge.mil at project [ <a href="https://software.forge.mil/sf/projects/magtf_c2" target="_blank">USMC - MAGTF C2</a> ] SVN repo [ <a href="https://svn.forge.mil/svn/repos/soimessaging/TsoaInformationModel/DataFormat/mtf.datatype" target="_blank">SoiMessaging</a> ].</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <p>The implementation of a SOI-provided NIEM-based data type, first and foremost, is dependent on having an end-point that will support a NIEM-based data type.  
            An end-point that supports a NIEM-based data type may also support a non-NIEM-based data type.  The NIEM-based data type package includes validation and transformation capabilities the end-point may implement.</p>
        <p></p>
        
        <h1>Maintenance</h1>
        <p>As with other software components, a data type and its packaged components should evolve to improve their usability and relevancy, both for information systems and their builders.  Towards this premise, SOI-provided XML data types and their packaged components shall be maintained.</p>
